### Project Details

Quidli is a micro on-ramp connecting Web 2.0 apps and web3 assets for you to embed crypto rewards and incentives into your collaboration workflows to boost participation and motivation. We enables you to recognize your top contributors natively in your Slack and or Discord, and is mainly used today by community managers who want to leverage community engagement on social media. Quidli users include the community teams NEAR Foundation, ETHDenver, OrangeDAO, iExec, Tezos, and Solana Foundation.

### Ecosystem Fit
We propose to you to build a light integration of Proton Protocol to Quidli by adding PROTON to our API and hosted app environment. This will enable you to seamlessly distribute PROTON as rewards to the top active participants in your community directly in your Slack or Discord.
In addition to helping you internally share PROTON within your community, this integration lets us offer PROTON to our user base of 1000+ organizations as an option via Quidli’s open token platform.

Through this initial partnership, we’d like to help Proton Protocol build an awesome community and ecosystem by enabling you to effectively boost community engagement using token incentives. 
Sharing more tokens with community members can help you to establish a positive alignment flywheel leading to more contributions and ultimately growth towards your main mission and objectives.
